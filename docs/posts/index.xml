          Abstract # This white paper looks to investigate the possibilities current AI/ML technologies can offer us regarding physical health and training, with a focus towards various martial arts. In the first part of this paper, we will look at the current state of the art. We will see some current ML/AI models and their learning environments and look at how these can be manipulated to work in the context of physical training.
